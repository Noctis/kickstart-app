# Upgrading from 2.3.0 to 3.0.0

Upgrading from a Kickstart 2.3.0-based application to a Kickstart 3.0.0 is easier than it may seem. There will be a
couple of things that you'll need to do, all of them explained in detail below:

* minor update to `.env` (and `.env-example`),
* update to `boostrap.php` file,
* optional removal of the configuration class - `App\Configuration\FancyConfiguration`
* updating routes list in `src/Http/Routing/routes.php` file to the new format,
* update to application's entry points: the `public/index.php` and `bin/console` files,
* updates to HTTP middleware and actions

## 1. Upgrading Dependencies

Execute the following commands to update the application's dependencies:

```shell
$ composer remove symfony/http-foundation
```

```shell
$ composer require --with-all-dependencies \
php:~8.0.0 \
noctis/kickstart:^3.0@dev \
laminas/laminas-diactoros:^2.8 \
psr/container:^1.1 \
psr/http-server-middleware:^1.0 \
symfony/console:^5.3 \
vlucas/phpdotenv:^5.3
```

```shell
$ composer require --dev --with-all-dependencies \
squizlabs/php_codesniffer:^3.6 \
symfony/var-dumper:^5.3 \
vimeo/psalm:^4.11
```

## 2. Updating `.env` and `.env-example`

Regarding the `.env` and `.env-example` files, only one thing has changed between Kickstart 2.3.0 and 3.0.0: the
`debug` option, with its `true` or `false` values has been replaced by `APP_ENV`, with `prod` or `dev` values.

Replace the:
```dotenv
debug=...
```

line in your `.env` and `.env-example` files with the following lines:
```dotenv
# Valid values: prod, dev
APP_ENV=...
```

Change its value accordingly:

| Before:       | After:         |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| `debug=false` | `APP_ENV=prod` |
| `debug=true`  | `APP_ENV=dev`  |

## 3. Migrating `bootstrap.php`

One major thing that has changed in the `boostrap.php` file between Kickstart 2.3.0 and 3.0.0, is the way that the
configuration options requirements are defined.

Replace the contents of your application's `boostrap.php` file with the
[`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/master/bootstrap.php).

Now you'll need to migrate your configuration requirements list to the new "format". In Kickstart 2.3.0, the
requirements were passed as an array:

```php
(new ConfigurationLoader())
    ->load(__DIR__, [
        'basehref' => 'required',
        'db_host'  => 'required',
        'db_user'  => 'required',
        'db_pass'  => 'required',
        'db_name'  => 'required',
        'db_port'  => 'required,int',
    ]);
```

In Kickstart 3.0.0 you are given access to the `Dotenv\Dotenv` instance, so you need to follow its rules:

* all the required options need to be passed, as an array, to the `Dotenv::required()` method:
  ```php
  $dotenv->required([
      'basehref',
      'db_host',
      'db_user',
      'db_pass',
      'db_name',
      'db_port'
  ]);
  ```
* if an option's value needs to be an integer, use the `Dotenv::isInteger()` method:
  ```php
  $dotenv->required('db_port')
      ->isInteger();
  ```
* if an option's value needs to be boolean, use the `Dotenv::isBoolean()` method:
  ```php
  $dotenv->required('banning_enabled')
      ->isBoolean();
  ```

Remember that the `debug` option has been replaced with the `APP_ENV` one, and is no longer boolean.

## 4. Migrating Configuration Classes

There were three major changes regarding the configuration classes between Kickstart 2.3.0 and 3.0.0:

* the `App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface` and `App\Configuration\FancyConfiguration` class are no longer
  part of a standard Kickstart application. That means that you may keep using them if you wish to, or remove them from
  your application altogether,
* all the methods offered by the `Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\Configuration` class are now static, and the class
  itself is no longer instantiable,
* the `Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\ConfigurationInterface` interface has been removed.

### 4.1 If You Wish to Remove `FancyConfiguration` Class

The `App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface` and `App\Configuration\FancyConfiguration` class themselves can be
safely deleted **only if** you have not added any other, custom getters to them. If that is not the case, but you still
wish to delete them, you will need to find calls to your custom methods and replace them with calls to the static 
`get()` method of the `Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\Configuration` class.

By default, the `App\Provider\DatabaseConnectionProvider` service provider makes use of the `FancyConfiguration` class. 
You need to replace calls to `FancyConfiguration`'s methods (`getDBName()`, `getDBHost()`, etc.) inside it with calls 
to static `get()` method of the `Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\Configuration` class.

For example, if your `DatabaseConnectionProvider` service provider looks like this:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Provider;

use App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Provider\ServicesProviderInterface;
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\EasyDB;
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\Exception\ConstructorFailed;
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\Factory;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

final class DatabaseConnectionProvider implements ServicesProviderInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function getServicesDefinitions(): array
    {
        return [
            EasyDB::class => function (ContainerInterface $container): EasyDB {
                try {
                    /** @var FancyConfigurationInterface $configuration */
                    $configuration = $container->get(FancyConfigurationInterface::class);

                    return Factory::fromArray([
                        sprintf(
                            'mysql:dbname=%s;host=%s;port=%s',
                            $configuration->getDBName(),
                            $configuration->getDBHost(),
                            $configuration->getDBPort()
                        ),
                        $configuration->getDBUser(),
                        $configuration->getDBPass()
                    ]);
                } catch (ConstructorFailed $ex) {
                    die('Could not connect to primary DB: ' . $ex->getMessage());
                }
            },
        ];
    }
}
```

you should modify it to look like this:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Provider;

use Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\Configuration;
use Noctis\KickStart\Provider\ServicesProviderInterface;
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\EasyDB;
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\Exception\ConstructorFailed;
use ParagonIE\EasyDB\Factory;

final class DatabaseConnectionProvider implements ServicesProviderInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function getServicesDefinitions(): array
    {
        return [
            EasyDB::class => function (): EasyDB {
                try {
                    /** @psalm-suppress MixedArgument */
                    return Factory::fromArray([
                        sprintf(
                            'mysql:dbname=%s;host=%s;port=%s',
                            Configuration::get('db_name'),
                            Configuration::get('db_host'),
                            Configuration::get('db_port')
                        ),
                        Configuration::get('db_user'),
                        Configuration::get('db_pass')
                    ]);
                } catch (ConstructorFailed $ex) {
                    die('Could not connect to primary DB: ' . $ex->getMessage());
                }
            },
        ];
    }
}
```

The `App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface` and `App\Configuration\FancyConfiguration` class themselves can be
safely deleted **only if** you have not added any other, custom methods to them. Assuming that is the case, and you wish 
to remove those two, first check if your `App\Provider\ConfigurationProvider` registers the 
`App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface` and nothing else. 

If your `ConfigurationProvider` class look like this:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Provider;

use App\Configuration\FancyConfiguration;
use App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\ConfigurationInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Provider\ServicesProviderInterface;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

final class ConfigurationProvider implements ServicesProviderInterface
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function getServicesDefinitions(): array
    {
        return [
            FancyConfigurationInterface::class => function (ContainerInterface $container): FancyConfiguration {
                /** @var ConfigurationInterface $baseConfiguration */
                $baseConfiguration = $container->get(ConfigurationInterface::class);

                return new FancyConfiguration($baseConfiguration);
            },
        ];
    }
}
```

then you can safely remove the following files:

* `src/Configuration/FancyConfiguration.php`,
* `src/Configuration/FancyConfigurationInterface.php`,
* `src/Provider/ConfigurationProvider.php`.

Lastly, edit the `App\Console\Application` and `App\Console\Application` classes and remove the references to the
`App\Provider\ConfigurationProvider` class.

### 4.2 If You Wish to Keep `FancyConfiguration` Class

If you decide to keep using your application's `FancyConfiguration` classes, first thing you should do is edit the 
`App\Configuration\FancyConfiguration` class and:

* remove `Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\ConfigurationInterface` as its injected dependency,
* remove its `getBaseHref()`, `get()`, `set()` and `has()` methods,
* replace all the calls to its `get()` method (inside the class and elsewhere in your application), with calls to the
  `Configuration::get()` static method, for example replace this:
  ```php
  public function getDBHost(): string
  {
      /** @var string */
      return $this->get('db_host');
  }
  ```
  with this:
  ```php
  public function getDBHost(): string
  {
      /** @var string */
      return Configuration::get('db_host');
  }
  ```

Check your application for other places where the `ConfigurationInterface` methods, i.e. `get()`, `set()`, `has()` or
`getBaseHref()` are called and replace those calls with calls to their static equivalents. For example, replace this:

```php
$basePath = $this->configuration
    ->get('basepath');
```

with this:
```php
$basePath = Configuration::get('basepath');
```

Replace the contents of your `App\Provider\ConfigurationProvider` service provider class with the
[`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/master/src/Provider/ConfigurationProvider.php).

Lastly, make sure your application's `App\Configuration\FancyConfigurationInterface` interface no longer extends the
now defunct `Noctis\KickStart\Configuration\ConfigurationInterface` one.

## 5. DIC Compilation

One major change introduced in Kickstart 3.0.0 is that the DIC (Dependency Injection Container) can now compile its
configuration and save it to a file, which greatly speeds up the dependency resolution process. For it to work, DIC
needs a folder into which it will save the compiled configuration files.

By default, that folder is `var/cache/container`, inside the root folder of your application. Create such a folder and
then create an empty file called `.empty` inside it (so that the directory can be committed). Lastly, add
the following lines to `.gitignore`, so that the compiled DIC files won't make their way into your VCS repository:

```gitignore
/var/cache/container/**
!/var/cache/container/.empty
```

## 6. Migrating to New Routes List Format

The HTTP routes list file - `src/Http/Routing/routes.php` has seen a format upgrade in Kickstart 3.0.0. A single
route is now a `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Routing\Route` object, instead of an array.

To migrate your routes list, edit the `src/Http/Routing/routes.php` file and edit the routes accordingly.

The `Route` class offers two static factory methods:

* `Route::get()` for routes available _via_ HTTP `GET` method,
* `Route::post()` for routes available _via_ HTTP `POST` method.

For example, you should replace this:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Http\Action\DummyAction;
use App\Http\Middleware\Guard\DummyGuard;

return [
    ['GET', '/', DummyAction::class, [DummyGuard::class]],
];
```

with this:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Http\Action\DummyAction;
use App\Http\Middleware\Guard\DummyGuard;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Routing\Route;

return [
    Route::get('/', DummyAction::class, [DummyGuard::class]),
];
```

## 7. Migrating Application's Entry Points

A standard Kickstart application has two entry points:

* `public/index.php` file, for Web-based applications, and
* `bin/console` for console-based (CLI) applications.

### 7.1 HTTP Entry Point

The Web entry point in a Kickstart application is the `public/index.php` file. Two major things changed between
Kickstart 2.3.0 and 3.0.0:

* the list of service providers for a web application has been moved from the `src/Http/Application.php` file to
  `public/index.php`,
* the list of routes (`src/Http/Routing/routes.php` file) is now passed to the
  `Noctis\KickStart\Provider\RoutingProvider`'s constructor, instead of the `App\Http\Application`'s one.

Start by replacing the contents of the `public/index.php` file with its
[`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/master/public/index.php).

Now lets deal with the service providers. Open the `src/Http/Application.php` file and make sure all the service
providers listed there, e.g.:

```php
// src/Http/Application.php

// ...

protected function getServiceProviders(): array
{
    return array_merge(
        parent::getServiceProviders(),
        [
            new ConfigurationProvider(),
            new DatabaseConnectionProvider(),
            new HttpMiddlewareProvider(),
            new DummyServicesProvider(),
            new RepositoryProvider(),
        ]
    );
}
```

are now properly being registered in the `public/index.php` file, _via_ the
`ContainerBuilder::registerServicesProvider()` method:

```php
// public/index.php

// ...

$containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();
$containerBuilder
    ->registerServicesProvider(new RoutingProvider(
        require_once __DIR__ . '/../src/Http/Routing/routes.php'
    ))
    ->registerServicesProvider(new ConfigurationProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new DatabaseConnectionProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new HttpMiddlewareProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new DummyServicesProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new RepositoryProvider())
;
```

Once you're done with migrating service providers registration to `public/index.php`, delete the
`src/Http/Application.php` file.

### 7.2 CLI Entry Point

The console (CLI) entry point in a Kickstart application is the `bin/console` file. Two major things changed between
Kickstart 2.3.0 and 3.0.0:

* the list of service providers for a console application has been moved from `src/Console/Application.php` file to
  `bin/console`,
* the way in which console commands are registered.

Start by replacing the contents of the `bin/console` file with its
[`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/master/bin/console).

Now, lets deal with the service providers. Open the `src/Console/Application.php` file and make sure all the service
providers listed there, e.g.:

```php
// src/Console/Application.php

// ...

protected function getServiceProviders(): array
{
    return array_merge(
        parent::getServiceProviders(),
        [
            new ConfigurationProvider(),
            new DatabaseConnectionProvider(),
            new DummyServicesProvider(),
            new RepositoryProvider(),
        ]
    );
}
```

are now properly being registered in the `bin/console` file, _via_ the `ContainerBuilder::registerServicesProvider()`
method:

```php
// bin/console

// ...

$containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();
$containerBuilder
    ->registerServicesProvider(new ConfigurationProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new DatabaseConnectionProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new DummyServicesProvider())
    ->registerServicesProvider(new RepositoryProvider())
;
```

Once that's done, we can deal with migrating the way that console commands are registered. In Kickstart 2.3.0 console
commands were registered by passing an array of their class names to the `App\Console\Application` constructor:

```php
// bin/console

$app = new Application([
    DummyCommand::class
]);
$app->run();
```

In Kickstart 3.0.0 and up, the commands are registered by passing the same array to the `setCommands()` method of the
`Noctis\KickStart\Console\ConsoleApplication` instance:

```php
// bin/console

/** @var ConsoleApplication $app */
$app = $container->get(ConsoleApplication::class);
$app->setCommands([
    DummyCommand::class
]);
```

If your application uses a custom commands loader, i.e. the `App\Console\Application::setCommandLoaderFactory()` method
is used, you'll need to switch to the `Noctis\KickStart\Console\ConsoleApplication::setCommandLoaderFactory()` method.
The new method's signature is exactly the same as the old one's.

Once you're done with migrating service providers registration and console commands in the `bin/console` file, delete
the `src/Console/Application.php` file.

## 8. Migrating HTTP Actions

In Kickstart 3.0.0 two major changes to HTTP actions classes have been introduced:

* all actions must implement the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface` interface,
* the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\AbstractAction` abstract class has been removed.

Start by modifying all the HTTP actions which extend the `AbstractAction` to now implement the `ActionInterface`
interface, i.e. replace this:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\AbstractAction;

final class DummyAction extends AbstractAction
{
    // ...
}
```

like so:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;

final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
{
    // ...
}
```

Next, replaced the `execute()` methods with the `process()` method, with the following signature:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): ResponseInterface
{
    // ...
}
```

If there were any dependencies injected through the `execute()` method, those will need to be moved to the action's
constructor class.

Because the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\AbstractAction` abstract class has been removed, actions will no longer have
access to certain helper functions, like `render()` or `redirect()`. Some of these functions - with the same signatures
as in the `AbstractAction` - are available through traits now. You will need to switch your actions to using those
traits and provide those traits with an instance of a specific response factory that they require.

### 8.1 The `render()` Method

The `render()` method is now available through the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RenderTrait`. This trait needs to be
provided an instance of `HtmlResponseFactoryInterface` into its private `$htmlResponseFactory` field:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Laminas\Diactoros\Response\HtmlResponse;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RenderTrait;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\HtmlResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
{
    use RenderTrait;

    public function __construct(HtmlResponseFactoryInterface $htmlResponseFactory)
    {
        $this->htmlResponseFactory = $htmlResponseFactory;
    }

    public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): HtmlResponse
    {
        // ...

        return $this->render(/* ... */);
    }
}
```

### 8.2 The `redirect()` Method

The `redirect()` method is now available through the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RedirectTrait`. This trait needs to
be provided an instance of `RedirectResponseFactoryInterface` into its private `$redirectResponseFactory` field:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Laminas\Diactoros\Response\RedirectResponse;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RedirectTrait;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\RedirectResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
{
    use RedirectTrait;

    public function __construct(RedirectResponseFactoryInterface $redirectResponseFactory)
    {
        $this->redirectResponseFactory = $redirectResponseFactory;
    }

    public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): RedirectResponse
    {
        // ...
        
        return $this->redirect(/* ... */);
    }
}
```

### 8.3 The `notFound()` Method

The `notFound()` method is now available through the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\NotFoundTrait`. This trait needs to
be provided an instance of `NotFoundResponseFactoryInterface` into its private `$notFoundResponseFactory` field:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Laminas\Diactoros\Response\EmptyResponse;
use Laminas\Diactoros\Response\TextResponse;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\NotFoundTrait;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\NotFoundResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
{
    use NotFoundTrait;

    public function __construct(NotFoundResponseFactoryInterface $notFoundResponseFactory)
    {
        $this->notFoundResponseFactory = $notFoundResponseFactory;
    }

    public function process(
        ServerRequestInterface $request,
        RequestHandlerInterface $handler
    ): EmptyResponse | TextResponse {
        // ...

        return $this->notFound(/* ... */);
    }
}
```

### 8.4 The `sendAttachment()` and `sendFile()` Methods

The `sendAttachment()` method is now available through the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\AttachmentTrait`. This trait
needs to be provided an instance of `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface` into its private `$attachmentResponseFactory`
field:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\AttachmentTrait;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\AttachmentResponse;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
{
    use AttachmentTrait;

    public function __construct(AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface $attachmentResponseFactory)
    {
        $this->attachmentResponseFactory = $attachmentResponseFactory;
    }

    public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): AttachmentResponse
    {
        // ...

        return $this->sendAttachment(/* ... */);
    }
}
```

The `sendFile()`, as it has been deprecated in Kickstart 2.1.0, needs to be replaced by `sendAttachment()` method.

The `AttachmentTrait` does offer some additional factory methods for creating an instance of `AttachmentResponse`:

* `sendFile()` - can be used as a shortcut for `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface::sendFile()`,
* `sendContent()` - can be used as a shortcut for `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface::sendContent()`,
* `sendResource()` - can be used as a shortcut for `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface::sendResource()`.

### 8.5 The `setFlashMessage()` and `getFlashMessage()` Methods

The `setFlashMessage()` and `getFlashMessage()` methods are now available in the
`Noctis\KickStart\Http\Service\FlashMessageServiceInterface` class. Although they are named the same as the methods
that used to be available through the `AbstractAction` class, they do have a slightly different signature. Before
Kickstart 3.0 both messages had a hard-coded flash message name in them - `message`. Since Kickstart 3.0, one can
define the flash message's name themselves.

So, you will need to replace usages of:

```php
$this->setFlashMessage('foo');
```

with:

```php
$this->setFlashMessage('message', 'foo');
```

and usages of:

```php
$this->getFlashMessage();
```

with:
```php

### 8.6 The `getBaseHref()` Method

The `getBaseHref()` method needs to be replaced with calls to the `createFromRequest()` method of
`Noctis\KickStart\Http\Factory\BaseHrefFactoryInterface`. The new method accepts one argument - an instance of
`Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface`, which is available in every action's `process()` method.

### 8.7 The `Disposition` Class

There have been two major, BC-breaking changes introduced to the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Headers\Disposition`
class:

* its constructor is now private, instead of public,
* two new static factory methods have been introduced inside it: `attachment()` and `inline()`.

Make sure to replace any calls to the `Disposition` class' constructor in your application:

```php
new Disposition(...);
```

with a call to the static `Disposition::attachment()` method:

```php
Disposition::attachment(...);
```

For example, if you have an HTTP action like this:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\AttachmentResponse;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Headers\Disposition;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

final class SendFileAction implements ActionInterface
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): AttachmentResponse
    {
        return $this->sendFile(
            '/tmp/result.png',
            'image/png',
            new Disposition('result.png')
        );
    }
}
```

modify it like so:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Action;

use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\AttachmentResponse;
use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Headers\Disposition;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

final class SendFileAction implements ActionInterface
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): AttachmentResponse
    {
        return $this->sendFile(
            '/tmp/result.png',
            'image/png',
            Disposition::attachment('result.png')
        );
    }
}

```

## 9. Migrating HTTP Middlewares/Guards

Compared to actions, middlewares/guards have seen fewer changes in Kickstart 3.0.0, so migration will be simpler.

One major thing is that the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Middleware\AbstractMiddleware` abstract class has been removed, so
you will need to make two things:

* make sure none of your middlewares/guards extend it,
* make sure all of your middlewares/guards implement the `Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface` (same as actions).

If any of your middlewares/guards calls the `AbstractMiddleware::process()` method, like so:

```php
return parent::process($request, $handler);
```

make sure to replace it with this:

```php
return $handler->handle($request);
```

Also, if any of your middlewares/guards have an instance of the now defunct `ResponseFactoryInterface` class injected
into it - get rid of it.

## 10. Migrating Custom Requests

The `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Request\Request` class has been renamed to `AbstractRequest` in Kickstart 3.0.0, and it is
now an abstract class, meaning it can't be instantiated on its own now, so you will have to change the name of the class
that your custom request classes extend, from `Request` to `AbstractRequest`.

The `getFiles()` method has been renamed to `getUploadedFiles()`, so that's another thing you'll need to locate and
correct.

Some additional methods have been added to the `AbstractRequest` class, i.e.:

* `getAttribute()`,
* `getParsedBody()`,
* `getQueryParams()`

Any calls to them are simply forwarded to the instance of `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface` the
`AbstractRequest` is decorating.

## 11. Migrating Away From `ResponseFactoryInterface`

One of the major changes introduced in Kickstart 3.0.0 was the removal of the
`Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\ResponseFactoryInterface` interface and the `ResponseFactory` class which implements
it. They were broken down into smaller, dedicated response factories (in the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory`
namespace), each of which replaces one of the `ResponseFactoryInterface`'s methods:

| `ResponseFactoryInterface` method | Replacement method(s) <br/> (in `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory` namespace) |
| --- | --- |
| `htmlResponse()` | `HtmlResponseFactoryInterface::render()` |
| `redirectionResponse()` | `RedirectResponseFactoryInterface::toPath()` |
| `fileResponse()` <br/> `attachmentResponse()` | `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface::sendFile()`, <br/> `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface::sendContent()`, or <br/> `AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface::sendResource()` |

You need to find uses of these `ResponseFactoryInterface` methods in your application and replace them with a use of
the appropriate new response factory.

## 12. Migrating Away From `FileInterface` & `FileResponse`

In Kickstart 2.3.0, the following interfaces and classes have been marked as deprecated:

* `Noctis\KickStart\File\FileInterface`,
* `Noctis\KickStart\File\File`,
* `Noctis\KickStart\File\InMemoryFile`, and
* `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\FileResponse`.

In Kickstart 3.0.0 those have been removed, so if your application is still using them, it's high time to migrate your
code. If your application uses neither of those, you can skip this section.

| Deprecated class | Replacement class |
| --- | --- |
| `Noctis\KickStart\File\FileInterface` | `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Attachment\AttachmentInterface` |
| `Noctis\KickStart\File\File` <br/> `Noctis\KickStart\File\InMemoryFile` | `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Attachment\Attachment` |
| `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\FileResponse` | `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\AttachmentResponse` |

To create a new instance of `Noctis\KickStart\File\File`, use the
`Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Attachment\AttachmentFactoryInterface::createFromPath()` method.

To create a new instance of `Noctis\KickStart\File\InMemoryFile`, use the
`Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Attachment\AttachmentFactoryInterface::createFromContent()` method.

## 13. Cherry on Top

Add the following to the `config` section in your `composer.json` file:

```json
"allow-plugins": {
    "composer/package-versions-deprecated": true
}
```

Modify the Kickstart version indicator in your application's `composer.json` file, like so:

```json
"extra": {
    "app-version": "3.0.0"
},
```

Finally, execute the following command in CLI to update your `composer.lock` accordingly:

```sh
$ composer update --lock
```

and we're done!
