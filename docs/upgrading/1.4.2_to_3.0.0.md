# Upgrading from 1.4.2 to 3.0.0

Starting with version 2.0, Kickstart has been split into two packages - the system and user parts. That means that
some files were moved to a different location, while some were changed.

Upgrade process from `1.4.2` to `3.0.0` is pretty straightforward, but there are a couple of files that need to be
modified by hand, i.e. it's not possible to just copy over their contents from the `3.0.0` branch.

## 1. Dependencies

* Remove the reference to the `git@bitbucket.org:NoctisPL/database-lib.git` repository in `composer.json`.
* Run the following command to remove packages:
  ```shell
  $ composer remove \
  ext-pdo \
  nikic/fast-route \
  noctis/database-lib \
  php-di/php-di \
  psr/http-server-middleware \
  symfony/console \
  symfony/http-foundation \
  twig/twig \
  vlucas/phpdotenv \
  symfony/var-dumper \
  vimeo/psalm
  ```
* Run the following commands to install new packages:

  ```shell
  $ composer require \
  php:~8.0.0 \
  composer-runtime-api:^2 \
  laminas/laminas-diactoros:^2.8 \
  noctis/kickstart:^3.0 \
  paragonie/easydb:^2.11 \
  php-di/php-di:^6.3 \
  psr/container:^1.1 \
  psr/http-message:^1.0 \
  psr/http-server-handler:^1.0 \
  symfony/console:^5.4 \
  vlucas/phpdotenv:^5.4
  ```

  ```shell
  $ composer require --dev \
  roave/security-advisories:dev-latest \
  squizlabs/php_codesniffer:^3.6 \
  symfony/var-dumper:^5.4 \
  vimeo/psalm:^4.19
  ```

* Since Psalm has been updated from 3.x to 4.x, and the new version's configuration file (`psalm.xml`) has a different
  format, run the following command to recreate it:
  ```shell
  $ mv psalm.xml psalm.xml.bak && vendor/bin/psalm --init
  ```

## 2. The Basics

* Replace the following lines in the `.env-example`:
  ```dotenv
  # Make sure it ends with a slash (/)!
  basepath=/
  ```
  with the following lines:
  ```dotenv
  # Valid values: prod, dev
  APP_ENV=dev
  # "/" for root-dir, "/foo" (without trailing slash) for sub-dir
  basehref=/
  ```
    * modify the `.env` file appropriately; **notice that the `basepath` option has been renamed to `basehref`!**
    * **in a production environment, you want to set the `APP_ENV` option in `.env` to `prod`**.
* Replace the contents of the `bootstrap.php` file in the project's root directory with the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/bootstrap.php). Copy the list of configuration
  options from the `src/Configuration.php` file.
* Delete the `src/Configuration.php` file.
* Replace all the calls to `getenv('BASEDIR')` and `$_ENV['BASEDIR']` in your application with calls to
  `$_ENV['basepath']`.
* Copy the `src/Configuration` directory from the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/tree/3.0.0/src/Configuration) into the project's root
  directory.
* Copy the `src/Database` directory from the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/tree/3.0.0/src/Database) into the project's root directory.
* Create the following directory path: `var/cache/container` in the project's root directory. Create an empty file
  called `.empty` inside it so that the directory can be committed into the VCS.
* Add the following lines to `.gitignore`:
  ```gitignore
  /var/cache/container/**
  !/var/cache/container/.empty
  ```

## 3. Service Providers

* Delete the `src/Provider/HttpServicesProvider.php`, `src/Provider/ServicesProviderInterface.php` and
  `src/Provider/TwigServiceProvider.php` files.
* Remove references to `App\Provider\HttpServicesProvider` and `App\Provider\TwigServiceProvider` providers from the
  `src/ContainerBuilder.php` file.
* Edit any Service Provider files within `src/Provider` directory and make sure those classes implement the
  `Noctis\KickStart\Provider\ServicesProviderInterface` interface.
* Check your service providers to see if the definitions inside them need to be updated appropriately for the definition
  format change introduced in Kickstart `2.0`. For example, the following definition, where a constructor parameter
  value is explicitly defined:
  ```php
  DummyGuard::class => [
      null, [
          'dummyParam' => getenv('dummy_param') === 'true',
      ]
  ],
  ```
  needs to be replaced with:
  ```php
  use function DI\autowire;
  
  DummyGuard::class => autowire(DummyGuard::class)
      ->constructorParameter(
          'dummyParam',
          $_ENV['dummy_param'] === true
      ),
  ```
* Replace the contents of the `src/Provider/DatabaseConnectionProvider.php` file with contents of the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/src/Provider/DatabaseConnectionProvider.php).
  If there were additional database connections defined there, you will need to transpose them appropriately, based on
  the primary database connection definition.
* Copy the [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/src/Provider/ConfigurationProvider.php)
  of the `ConfigurationProvider.php` file into the `src/Provider` directory.

## 4. HTTP Related Things

* Replace the contents of the `templates/layout.html.twig` file with the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/templates/layout.html.twig). **Be sure to check
  its contents and restore any custom changes that were there beforehand!**
* Create the following directory path: `var/cache/templates` in the project's root directory. Create an empty file
  called `.empty` inside it so that the directory can be committed into the VCS.
* Add the following lines to `.gitignore`:
  ```gitignore
  /var/cache/templates/**
  !/var/cache/templates/.empty
  ```

### 4.1 HTTP Middlewares

* Edit any `*Guard.php` files in the `src/Http/Middleware/Guard` directory and make sure those classes implement the
  `Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface` interface.
* Change the signature of their `process()` method from:
  ```php
  <?php 

  declare(strict_types=1);

  namespace App\Http\Middleware\Guard;

  use App\Http\Middleware\RequestHandlerInterface;
  use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
  use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

  final class DummyGuard implements GuardMiddlewareInterface
  {
      // ...

      public function process(Request $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): Response
      {
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```
  to (**notice the change to `RequestHandlerInterface` import line!**):
  ```php
  <?php

  declare(strict_types=1);

  namespace App\Http\Middleware\Guard;

  use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

  final class DummyGuard implements MiddlewareInterface
  {
      // ...

      public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): ResponseInterface
      {
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```
* If the middleware uses the `App\Http\Helper\HttpRedirectionTrait` trait:
    * replace it with a reference to `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RedirectTrait`,
    * make sure an instance of `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\RedirectResponseFactoryInterface` is injected
      into the trait's `$redirectResponseFactory` field (through the middleware's constructor).
* If the middleware uses the `App\Http\Helper\FlashMessageTrait` trait:
    * remove the reference to it from the middleware,
    * make sure an instance of `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Service\FlashMessageServiceInterface` is injected into the
      middleware, through its constructor,
    * use the `FlashMessageServiceInterface::setFlashMessage()` and `FlashMessageServiceInterface::getFlashMessage()`
      methods, in place of calls to the trait's `setFlashMessage()` and `getFlashMessage()` methods, respectively.
* Delete the `src/Http/Middleware/Guard/GuardMiddlewareInterface.php` file.

### 4.2 HTTP Actions

* Rename & move the `src/Http/Routes/StandardRoutes.php` file to `src/Http/Routing/routes.php` (**notice the
  subdirectory name change, from `Routes` to `Routing`!**)..
* Modify the `src/Http/Routing/routes.php` appropriately. For example, if the file originally looked like this:
  ```php
  <?php declare(strict_types=1);
  namespace App\Http\Routes;

  use App\Http\Action\DummyAction;
  use App\Http\Middleware\Guard\DummyGuard;
  use FastRoute\RouteCollector;

  final class StandardRoutes
  {
      public function get(): callable
      {
          return function (RouteCollector $r): void {
              $r->addGroup(
                  getenv('basepath'),
                  function (RouteCollector $r) {
                      $r->get('[{name}]', [
                          DummyAction::class,
                          [
                              DummyGuard::class,
                          ],
                      ]);
                  }
              );
          };
      }
  }
  ```
  it should now look like this:
  ```php
  <?php

  declare(strict_types=1);

  use App\Http\Action\DummyAction;
  use App\Http\Middleware\Guard\DummyGuard;

  return [
      Route::get('/[{name}]', DummyAction::class, [DummyGuard::class]),
  ];
  ```
* Delete the `src/Http/Router.php` file.
* Replace the contents of the `public/index.php` file in the project's root directory with the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/public/index.php).
* Edit the `public/index.php` file and:
    * copy over list of service provides from the `src/ContainerBuilder.php` file and use calls to
      `Noctis\KickStart\Http\ContainerBuilder::registerServicesProvider()` method to register them,
    * remove registrations of any service provider that do not exist,
    * make sure `App\Provider\ConfigurationProvider` is on the list.
* Edit the `public/.htaccess` file and add the following lines:
  ```apacheconf
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
  RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301]
  ```
  between:
  ```apacheconf
  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
  ```
  and:
  ```apacheconf
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
  ```
* Delete the `src/Http/Request/AbstractRequest.php` file.
* Edit any `*Action.php` files within `src/Http/Action` directory (except `BaseAction.php`) and:
    * make sure those classes implement the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface` interface,
    * rename their `execute()` methods to `process()` with the following signature:
      ```php
      <?php
  
      declare(strict_types=1);
  
      namespace App\Http\Action;
  
      use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
      use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
      use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;
      
      // ...
      
      /**
       * @inheritDoc
       */
      public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): ResponseInterface
      {
          // ...
      }
      ```
    * if the `execute()` method had dependencies injected into it, eg:
      ```php
      <?php declare(strict_types=1);
      namespace App\Http\Action;
    
      use App\Service\DummyServiceInterface;
      use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
    
      final class DummyAction extends BaseAction
      {
          public function execute(DummyServiceInterface $dummyService): Response
          {
              // ...
          }
      }
      ``` 
      inject them into the action through the action's constructor, eg:
      ```php
      <?php 
  
      declare(strict_types=1);
    
      namespace App\Http\Action;
    
      use App\Service\DummyServiceInterface;
      use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
    
      final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
      {
          private DummyServiceInterface $dummyService;
  
          public function __construct(DummyServiceInterface $dummyService)
          {
              $this->dummyService = $dummyService;
          }
      
          // ...
      }
      ```
    * make sure `process()` method type-hints returning either `HtmlResponse`, `RedirectResponse`, `JsonResponse` or
      `EmptyResponse` from the `Laminas\Diactoros\Response` namespace, e.g. `Laminas\Diactoros\Response\HtmlResponse`,
    * if the given action returns an HTML response, i.e. has the `return $this->render(...);` line:
        * include the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RenderTrait` trait in it, and
        * make sure an instance of `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\HtmlResponseFactoryInterface` is injected into
          the trait's `$htmlResponseFactory` field (through the action's constructor),
    * if the given action returns a redirection, i.e. has the `return $this->redirect(...);` line:
        * include the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\RedirectTrait` trait in it, and
        * make sure an instance of `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\RedirectResponseFactoryInterface` is injected
          into the trait's `$redirectResponseFactory` field (through the action's constructor),
    * if the given action returns (sends) a file in response:
        * include the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\AttachmentTrait` trait in it, and
        * make sure an instance of `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\AttachmentResponseFactoryInterface` is injected
          into the trait's `$attachmentResponseFactory` field (through the action's constructor),
        * use one of the methods provided by the `AttachmentTrait`, accordingly to what you're sending to the browser:
            * `sendFile()` - if you want to send a file which already exists on a storage device,
            * `sendContent()` - if you want to send string data which is currently stored in a variable,
            * `sendResource()` - if you want to send a
              [PHP resource](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.resource.php).
    * if the given action returns a "not found" (404) response, i.e. has the `return $this->notFound();` line:
        * include the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Helper\NotFoundTrait` trait in it, and
        * make sure an `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Response\Factory\NotFoundResponseFactoryInterface` is injected into the
          trait's `$notFoundResponseFactory` field (through the action's constructor).
* If there were no custom methods added to the `App\Http\Action\BaseAction` abstract class, delete the
  `src/Http/Action/BaseAction.php` file.
* Delete the `src/Http/Factory`, `src/Http/Helper` directories.
* Delete the `ActionInvoker.php`, `RequestHandlerInterface.php` and `RequestHandlerStack.php` files from the
  `src/Http/Middleware` directory.

### 4.3 Migrating Custom Requests

* Edit any custom request classes in your application and make sure they now extend the
  `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Request\AbstractRequest` class, instead of the now non-existent
  `App\Http\Request\AbstractRequest` one,
* Replace any calls to the request's `getFiles()` method with calls to the `getUploadedFiles()` method,
* The request's `getSession()` method has been removed in Kickstart 2.0.0. You can find more information on how to
  implement session handling in your application in the Kickstart's
  [Implementing Session Handling](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/docs/cookbook/Implementing_Session_Handling.md)
  cookbook recipe,
* The request's `getClientIp()` method has also been removed in Kickstart 2.0.0. You can find more information on how to
  acquire the client's IP address in Kickstart's
  [Acquiring Client IP Address](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/docs/cookbook/Acquiring_Client_IP_Address.md)
  cookbook recipe,
* The request's `getBasePath()` method has been removed in Kickstart 3.0.0. Replace any calls to it with calls to the
  `createFromRequest()` method of the `Noctis\KickStart\Http\Factory\BaseHrefFactoryInterface`, for example replace
  this (**notice:** the following code shows an action already migrated to Kickstart 3.0):
  ```php
  <?php

  declare(strict_types=1);

  namespace Bartender\Http\Action;

  use Bartender\Http\Request\DummyRequest;
  use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

  final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
  {
      private DummyRequest $dummyRequest;

      /**
       * @param DummyRequest $dummyRequest
       */
      public function __construct(DummyRequest $dummyRequest)
      {
          $this->dummyRequest = $dummyRequest;
      }

      public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): ResponseInterface
      {
          $basePath = $this->request
              ->getBasePath();
        
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```
  like this:
  ```php
  <?php
  
  declare(strict_types=1);
  
  namespace Bartender\Http\Action;
  
  use Bartender\Http\Request\DummyRequest;
  use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Action\ActionInterface;
  use Noctis\KickStart\Http\Factory\BaseHrefFactoryInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
  use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;
  
  final class DummyAction implements ActionInterface
  {
      private DummyRequest $dummyRequest;
      private BaseHrefFactoryInterface $baseHrefFactory;
  
      /**
       * @param DummyRequest $dummyRequest
       */
      public function __construct(DummyRequest $dummyRequest, BaseHrefFactoryInterface $baseHrefFactory)
      {
          $this->dummyRequest = $dummyRequest;
          $this->baseHrefFactory = $baseHrefFactory;
      }
  
      public function process(ServerRequestInterface $request, RequestHandlerInterface $handler): ResponseInterface
      {
          $basePath = $this->baseHrefFactory
              ->createFromRequest($request);
  
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```

## 5. Console Related Things

* Replace the contents of the `bin/console` file in the project's root directory with the
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/bin/console).
* Edit the `bin/console` file:
    * copy over list of service provides from the `src/ContainerBuilder.php` file and use calls to
      `Noctis\KickStart\Http\ContainerBuilder::registerServicesProvider()` method to register them,
    * remove registrations of any HTTP-related (eg: `App\Provider\HttpMiddlewareProvider`) or non-existent service
      providers,
    * make sure `App\Provider\ConfigurationProvider` is on the list,
    * make sure to restore any references to console commands classes (classes from the `App/Console/Command` namespace)
      from the original file, so that those commands can still be called from the CLI.
* Edit any `*Command.php` files within `src/Console/Command` directory (except `BaseCommand.php`) and make sure those
  classes extend the `Noctis\KickStart\Console\Command\AbstractCommand` abstract class.
* Remove the `src/Console/Command/BaseCommand.php` file.

## 6. Repositories

* Rename the `DatabaseRepository` class in the `src/Repository` directory to `AbstractDatabaseRepository` and replace
  its contents with the contents of its
  [`3.0` version](https://github.com/Noctis/kickstart-app/blob/3.0.0/src/Repository/AbstractDatabaseRepository.php)
  version.
* Edit any `*Repository.php` files inside the `src/Repository` (except `AbstractDatabaseRepository.php`) directory and
  make sure those classes extend the local `AbstractDatabaseRepository` abstract class.

## 7. What's Left

* Delete the `src/ContainerBuilder.php` file.
* Add the following to the `config` section in your `composer.json` file:
  ```json
  "allow-plugins": {
      "composer/package-versions-deprecated": true
  }
  ```
* Modify your `composer.json` file by adding the following `extra` section to it:
  ```json
  "extra": {
      "app-version": "3.0.0"
  }
  ```
* Run the following command in your console to update your `composer.lock` file:
  ```sh
  $ composer update --lock
  ```

and we're done!
